	<h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>In the beginning, Steve was opposed to third-party apps, and wanted developers to create web apps that could be used through the device’s mobile Safari web browser. According to Apple board member, Art Levinson, “Jobs at first quashed the discussion” of allowing apps on the company’s debut smartphone.</p>
	<p>However, web apps never really took off, and Steve changed his mind — announcing in October, 2007, that a software development kit for the iPhone would be available the following year.</p>
	<p>In July, 2008, the App Store was born. It is now one of the iPhone’s biggest selling points, with a recent advertising campaign that was based on the tagline, <strong>“There’s an app for that.”</strong></p>
	<p>The App Store is now home to over 500,000 apps, and is the largest and most successful mobile application store available, with over 18 billion downloads since it opened its doors.</p><strong>Do you think the iPhone would be as successful as it is today without the birth of the App Store?</strong>
